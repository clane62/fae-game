# The Fae Forest

For my final project at General Assembly I wanted to create something fun that was quite different to everything else I've made so far. 

The Fae Forest is a trivia game, connected to an api that draws in trivia questions for the user to answer. For each question answered, the user collects a crystal and moves through levels to defeat the fae that insult you as you go. 

The game can be found [here](https://fae-game.surge.sh/).

## About

This game was created using react. I chose react as this was the platform we learned most recently at GA and one I felt the least confortable with. Creating this app allowed me to practice and learn a lot more about react's features. 

##  Planning & Problem Solving
- The first step involved planning out the pathway of the game. I knew early on what I wanted the aesthetics to look like, although I eventually simplified this a little. The iniital concepts involved several extra games that I would still like to explore as bonus rounds.
